		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Pizza Tonno is a special kind of pizza. Instead of the usual meat, this pizza is topped with <strong>fish!</strong>. Even better, you can divide the pizza into multiple pieces, making it easy to share with friends.</p>
		<p>It is not difficult to make. Follow the recipe and you will have your own amazing meal in no time!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 recipe for pizza dough</li>
			<li>200 gram passata</li>
			<li>150 gram grated mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>2 cans of tuna (in water, sunflower or olive oil)</li>
			<li>1 large red onion or 2 small ones</li>
			<li>pepper and salt to taste</li>
			<li>all-purpose flour</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Start creating the pizza dough, or use a store-bought pizza crust. DRAIN the canned tuna and add them to the small bowl. PEEL the red onion and chop into thin rings.</li>
			<li>PRE-HEAT the oven to 200 degrees Celsius or 390 degrees Fahrenheit. DUST your work surface and rolling-pin with flour and roll out the dough until you've reached a round pizza crust. </li>
			<li>TRANSFER the crust to the baking tray lined with parchment paper. COVER the pizza crust with passata and divide the red onion rings and tuna over the crust.</li>
		    <li>DIVIDE a package of grated mozzarella (150 gram) over the pizza and season with pepper and salt. </li>
            <li>BAKE the pizza tonno for about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on your oven and thickness of the pizza crust. TRANSFER to a large plate or board and divide into pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve with a delicious garlic sauce if you like and enjoy!</li>
